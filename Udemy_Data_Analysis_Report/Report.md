## Project Description 
The project is focused on processing data from Udemy in order to see how the organization can improve its business model and boost its revenue.
Udemy is an online learning platform that helps students, companies, and governments gain the skills they need to reach their goals. They have over 57 million learners, 213k courses and over 74k instructors.
Course sales and subscribers’ trends data will be analyzed to understand patterns and then make necessary recommendations.

*This analysis and data visulization was done using excel*

## Key Questions 
To be able to draw meaningful conclusions and have a pathway to follow in carrying out the analysis, certain questions have been set out to be answered as we analyze the data.   
#### Key questions include;
 - Q1: What are the total numbers of subscribers in each subject?
 - Q2: How does the average content duration/price/number of students vary across different subjects?
 - Q3: How many courses are free and paid for each subject?
 - Q4: What is the average price of web development courses at different levels?
 - Q5: What are the 20 most popular courses? Also, include the following information:
    - Their level
    - Whether they are free or paid
    - Whether any are free beginner courses
    - Duration of the course

- Q6: Does content duration impact the price of the course?

## Preliminary Action
To ensure a suitable data needed to get accurate and meaniful outcome, data cleaning was first carried out by 
- removing duplicates
- removing empty rows and columns
- properly formatting some values to ensure consistency in the data

## Findings from the data
After data cleaning  analyses were then carried out on the data using different methods.
An **exploratory data analysis** was first carried out before conducting in-depth analysis, this helped to become familiar with the dataset. The below shows some of the descriptive data gotten by calculating some measures of central tendencies from the data.

After the descriptive statistics were obtained to have a preliminary knowledge of the data, I went ahead to carry out in-depth data analysis which involved 
- creating pivots tables from the data 
- and then translating information on the pivot tables into visual representation for better insights and site patterns, trends, and synopsis.

## Answers to Key Questions
 Answers to some of the key questions were beginning to pop-up during the in-depth analysis.

## Summary of findings
Some of the conclusion that can be drawn from the findings include;
The analysis showed that among the four (4) subjects which students subscribed to on Udemy from the data, web development has the highest subscriber with about 68% of the total students.
Though web development has the highest average price, it is still the most purchased subject from the courses on Udemy
It was also seen that the course content duration doesn’t determine the price of courses.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings from the analysis highlighted below are some recommendations;
Advertisement should be more on web development as this is the subject area with higher subscribers and this can help generate more revenue if subscribers are aware of all the courses in this subject
Feedback should be obtained from subscribers from the subjects with fewer subscribers to know if this low users is just due to fewer students interested in that subject area or poor course contents.
Prices for courses within web development can be adjusted a little higher for more revenue.
